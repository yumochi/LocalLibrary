# LocalLibrary
<<<<<<< HEAD
A sample library project using vanilla java, mongoDB backend with Mongoose base on the MDN tutorial. I plan to expand on this work by making the project deployable on Heroku and switch to React.js. User will be create, modify and browse information regarding books, authors and genre. The project is also paired with nodemon to make development easier. I plan to adopt the work to react and add a bit of sugar to the front end.
